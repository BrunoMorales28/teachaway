# Teachaway

Bruno Morales' Tech challenge for teachaway's Front End position

## Installation

To start the project after cloning the repo, open a terminal window and run

### `npm run install`

Once dependencies were downloaded, run

### `npm run start`

This should host the app and run it directly in your default browser, connecting to localhost:3000.
Close or ignore this tab. Instead, go to 127.0.0.1:3000

The app should now be running properly.

This is because localhost is not a valid address for imgur server when it recieves a request.

## The App
